This is just an automatic discord updater, hopefully this saves the hassle of updating and upgrading Discord for Linux (.deb)

# THIS IS DESIGNED FOR DEBIAN DERIVERATIVE LINUX ONLY! RED HAT BASED LINUX OSES ARE NOT SUPPORTED IN THIS SCRIPT!

# Steps to use it
1. clone the repo with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UnusedCheese358/discord-installer
```
2. make sure the bash script is executable
```bash
chmod +X discord-autoupdater.sh
```
3. Run the script
```bash
./discord-autoupdater.sh
```
Note that you will be required to provide your administrator (`sudo`) password in order to have the perms to install the package
4. Sit back and let it brew.
5. Done! Discord should be at its latest version at this point. All the residual files will be removed for you.
